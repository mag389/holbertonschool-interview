# Substring search:

a function that searches a string for a substring containing all the words from a given list.
The substring must contain the words from the given list and no other characters.
If there is no such substring found returns NULL.


To save memory (a very small amount, just for practice) i used bitwise operators to store info about if words had been already used.
