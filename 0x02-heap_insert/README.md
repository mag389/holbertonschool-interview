# heap insert
Another holberton practice interview question, this time implementing
a heap insert into a binary tree.

The code for this is written in c using gcc 4.8.4 to compile with lines:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 0-main.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 0-node

and 

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 1-main.c 1-heap_insert.c 0-binary_tree_node.c -o 1-heap_insert

which creates executable files 0-node and 1-insert respectively
